# Decorator Pattern

Decorators have the same type as the objects they decorate. Decorators add their own behavior to the object that it
decorates. Decorators use inheritance for type-matching and composition to get behaviour.

The decorator pattern can be thought of as a wrapper or more formally a way to enhance or extend the behavior of an
object dynamically. The pattern provides an alternative to subclassing when new functionality is desired.
